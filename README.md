I have been working in tech for the most part since 2007 when I was employed as an Enterprise Network Technician as a student at CSU. Since then I have run a cellphone store, ran an IT help desk, profssionally built PCs, and will now be once again working help desk. During that time I have also done a fair bit of work doing film and television production and was a teaching assistant during my second bachelor's degree.
